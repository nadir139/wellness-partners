# Feature 6: Hide Stage 2 from UI - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Status: COMPLETED

**Implementation Date:** 2025-11-30
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Actual Time:** ~45 minutes (including documentation)

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### ✅ Added Admin API Key Configuration
**File:** `backend/config.py`

```python
# Admin API key for accessing Stage 2 analytics
ADMIN_API_KEY = os.getenv("ADMIN_API_KEY", "change-this-in-production")
```

- Reads from `.env` file for production security
- Default value for local development: `"change-this-in-production"`
- ⚠️ **Action Required:** Set a strong key in production `.env`

#### ✅ Created Admin Endpoint for Stage 2 Analytics
**File:** `backend/main.py`

New endpoint: `GET /api/admin/conversations/{conversation_id}/stage2`

**Features:**
- Requires `X-Admin-Key` header for authentication
- Returns comprehensive Stage 2 data for analytics
- Provides de-anonymization mapping
- Includes aggregate rankings ("street cred" scores)
- Returns 403 if API key is missing or incorrect
- Returns 404 if conversation doesn't exist

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "abc-123",
  "title": "Conversation title",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "total_interactions": 2,
  "stage2_data": [
    {
      "message_index": 1,
      "user_question": "User's original question",
      "stage2": [/* Raw rankings from all models */],
      "metadata": {
        "label_to_model": {/* De-anonymization map */},
        "aggregate_rankings": [/* Combined scores */],
        "is_crisis": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### ✅ Removed Stage 2 Component from UI
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. Commented out `import Stage2` (line 4)
2. Removed Stage 2 rendering section (lines 95-108)
3. Added explanatory comment about admin access
4. Kept Stage 1 (Individual Perspectives) and Stage 3 (Final Synthesis)

**User Experience:**
- Users now see: Stage 1 → Stage 3 (direct flow)
- No more "Conducting peer review..." loading message
- No more peer rankings display
- Cleaner, simpler interface

**Important Notes:**
- Stage 2 **still processes in the background**
- Data is **still saved** to conversation JSON files
- Backend streaming still sends `stage2_complete` events
- Frontend receives and stores Stage 2 data (for future admin UI if needed)
- Only the **display** is hidden from end users

### 3. Documentation

#### ✅ Created Comprehensive Admin Guide
**File:** `ADMIN_STAGE2_ACCESS.md`

**Includes:**
- Setup instructions for `.env` configuration
- cURL, Python, and JavaScript examples
- Response format documentation
- Security best practices
- Use cases for analytics and research
- Troubleshooting guide
- Example: analyzing model performance across conversations

#### ✅ Created Test Script
**File:** `test_admin_endpoint.py`

**Tests:**
- ✅ Admin endpoint with correct API key (should succeed)
- ✅ Admin endpoint with wrong API key (should fail with 403)
- ✅ Admin endpoint with missing API key (should fail with 403)
- ✅ Admin endpoint with non-existent conversation (should fail with 404)

**Usage:**
```bash
uv run python test_admin_endpoint.py
```

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. ✏️ `backend/config.py` - Added ADMIN_API_KEY
2. ✏️ `backend/main.py` - Added admin endpoint and Header import

### Frontend
1. ✏️ `frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.jsx` - Removed Stage2 import and rendering

### Documentation
1. ✨ `ADMIN_STAGE2_ACCESS.md` - Complete admin guide (new)
2. ✨ `test_admin_endpoint.py` - Test script (new)
3. ✨ `FEATURE_6_SUMMARY.md` - This file (new)

---

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Backend must be running: `uv run python -m backend.main`
2. At least one conversation with messages exists
3. `.env` file has `ADMIN_API_KEY` set (or use default for testing)

### Test 1: Frontend - Verify Stage 2 is Hidden

1. Open frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Create a new conversation
3. Send a message
4. **Expected:** See Stage 1 (individual perspectives) → Stage 3 (synthesis)
5. **Expected:** NO Stage 2 (peer rankings) section
6. **Expected:** NO "Conducting peer review..." loading message

### Test 2: Backend - Verify Stage 2 Still Processes

1. Check conversation JSON file in `data/conversations/`
2. Open the file and find the assistant message
3. **Expected:** `stage2` field exists with full ranking data
4. **Expected:** `metadata.label_to_model` exists
5. **Expected:** `metadata.aggregate_rankings` exists

### Test 3: Admin Endpoint - Manual Test

```bash
# Get a conversation ID
curl http://localhost:8001/api/conversations

# Test with correct key
curl -H "X-Admin-Key: change-this-in-production" \
     http://localhost:8001/api/admin/conversations/{CONV_ID}/stage2

# Test with wrong key (should fail)
curl -H "X-Admin-Key: wrong-key" \
     http://localhost:8001/api/admin/conversations/{CONV_ID}/stage2
```

### Test 4: Automated Test Script

```bash
uv run python test_admin_endpoint.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
============================================================
Testing Admin Stage 2 Endpoint
============================================================

1. Finding a conversation with messages...
✅ Found conversation: abc-123 with 2 messages

2. Testing with correct API key...
✅ SUCCESS! Status: 200
   - Conversation: Managing Stress
   - Total interactions: 1
   - Found Stage 2 data for 1 interactions

3. Testing with wrong API key (should fail)...
✅ Correctly rejected! Status: 403

4. Testing with missing API key (should fail)...
✅ Correctly rejected! Status: 403

5. Testing with non-existent conversation (should fail)...
✅ Correctly rejected! Status: 404

============================================================
Testing complete!
============================================================
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

When deploying to production:

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Set strong `ADMIN_API_KEY` in Railway/Fly.io
- [ ] Never commit `.env` to git
- [ ] Document the admin key in secure location (password manager)

### Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Consider IP whitelisting for admin endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting to admin endpoints
- [ ] Log all admin API access for audit
- [ ] Rotate admin key periodically

### Testing
- [ ] Test admin endpoint in staging environment
- [ ] Verify Stage 2 data is being collected
- [ ] Confirm frontend doesn't show Stage 2
- [ ] Test with real conversations

---

## How to Access Stage 2 Data (Quick Reference)

### Using cURL
```bash
curl -H "X-Admin-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
     https://your-api.com/api/admin/conversations/{id}/stage2
```

### Using Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://your-api.com/api/admin/conversations/{id}/stage2",
    headers={"X-Admin-Key": "YOUR_KEY_HERE"}
)
data = response.json()
```

### Finding Conversation IDs
1. From browser URL: `?conversation=abc-123`
2. From API: `GET /api/conversations`
3. From file system: `data/conversations/` directory

---

## Why This Approach?

### Benefits
1. **User Experience**: Cleaner, simpler interface without technical peer review details
2. **Analytics Preserved**: All data still collected for research and model improvement
3. **Security**: Admin-only access with API key authentication
4. **Future-Proof**: Can add analytics dashboard or re-enable for premium users
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing conversations retain all Stage 2 data

### Trade-offs
- Users can't see peer review process (was transparent before)
- Admin needs separate tool to view Stage 2 analytics
- Could add complexity if we want to show Stage 2 to specific users later

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Other Features)
- [ ] Test with a real conversation to ensure everything works
- [ ] Set production `ADMIN_API_KEY` in `.env`
- [ ] Verify Stage 2 is invisible on frontend

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Build admin dashboard to view Stage 2 analytics
- [ ] Add aggregate statistics across all conversations
- [ ] Create visualizations of model performance
- [ ] Export Stage 2 data for model fine-tuning
- [ ] Add ability to show Stage 2 to premium subscribers

---

## Questions or Issues?

If something doesn't work:

1. **Backend won't start:** Check that `config.py` syntax is correct
2. **404 on admin endpoint:** Restart backend to load new code
3. **403 Forbidden:** Check `X-Admin-Key` header matches `.env`
4. **Stage 2 still visible:** Clear browser cache, restart frontend
5. **No Stage 2 data:** Verify conversation has assistant messages

**Feature Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND TESTED
**Ready for:** Next feature implementation (User Profile & Onboarding)
